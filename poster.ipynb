    "The moderator temperature reactivity coefficient is the major contributor to the power coefficient in a boiling water reactor. The power coefficient determines the feedback effect of increasing the power generated by the reactor (and therefore neutron density as well as heat generation). Generally, we see that increasing power will lead to an increase in the temperature of the water used to moderate the reactor. This will reduce the density of the water, and therefore its effectiveness as a moderator. We would expect that this would lead to lower reactivity, and the equation developed below reflects this. We can estimate the numerical effects of moderator temperature on reactivity by using a linearization of the effect of increasing temperature on the neutron multiplecation factor (K), which is used to derive reactivity. \n",

    "### Neutron Density\n",
    "During startup, neutron density follows a predictable sigmoid shape, rapidly shooting up and then slowing down until steady state is reached (1.0 being the reactor steady state neutron density). Steady-state is maintained for about 20 minutes until the reactor enters shutdown and neutron density gradually drops to zero. Kinetics are quite fast, due mostly to the lack of fission product poison modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutron density also drops slightly about 15 minutes after steady state is reached. High moderator temperature results in negative reactivity insertion and a corresponding drop in neutron density.\n",

    "The six delayed neutron emitter groups follow a similar pattern to neutron density during startup and shutdown, the difference in levels being due to the different $beta_i$ yields given in the one-group neutron energy balance. This chart shows the relative abundance of each of the delayed neutron precursor groups, in relation to steady state reactor neutron density. The small drop in density observed in the neutron density around the 25 minute mark can also be observed here.\n",

    "### Condenser Outflow Temperature\n",
    "The outflow temperature of water from the condenser begins at room temperature, and gradually increases to around 303 K as the plant starts up and higher energy runoff exits from the low-pressure turbines. The decrease in outflow temperature occurs at the same time as the drop in neutron density.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "The plant behaves generally as it should, with the models of the major unit operations following the sigmoid shapes which would be expected in real plant operation. Some of the individual steady state values (i.e. the power produced by the turbines) are not quite correct, and will require some fixes to the parameters being used by the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, the Cortix library has proved its worth in modelling large, dynamic systems of multiple modules. Further work could be done to scale the system into a much larger more complex plant, including additional turbines and unit operations such as pumping or safety systems."
